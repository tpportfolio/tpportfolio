## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React / ReactDOM 18.3.1
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Local setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

Checks: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

The assistant needs `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env.local`. Without it the site works and the assistant answers that it is offline.

## Key routes

- Home: `/`
- About: `/about`
- Timeline: `/timeline`
- Work: `/work/ai-experiments`, `/work/independent-consultant`, `/work/air-new-zealand`, `/work/walt-disney-company`, `/work/agency-experience`
- Contact: `/contact`
- Magaiba: `/magaiba` (not in the sidebar)
- Agent mode: `/agents.md`, `/agents.txt`
- Assistant API: `POST /api/chat`
- Design lab (draft, not indexed): `/drafts/design-lab`

## Where the content lives

- `lib/site-content.ts`: identity, home frames, timeline entries (feeds `/agents.md` and the assistant).
- `lib/work-videos.ts`: every video shown in the work pages and the timeline.
- `lib/agents.ts`: builds `/agents.md` and `/agents.txt`.
- `content/assistant/*.md`: the assistant's knowledge base.
- `translations/index.ts`: shared UI strings.

## Intro (first visit)

- Static page: `/intro.html` (served from `public/intro.html`).
- `middleware.ts` redirects first-time visits to the intro using a cookie flag (`tp_intro`).
- The intro returns to the original route via hash.

## Mini tools (static)
